# 🧠 Knowledge Base

Everything I read, find, and want to remember — summarized, categorized, and version-controlled.

> Drop it. Summarize it. File it. Never lose it again.

## Categories

| Folder | What goes here |
|--------|---------------|
| `engineering/` | Systems, architecture, org patterns, how things are built at scale |
| `hands-on/` | Tools, experiments, walkthroughs, things to try yourself |
| `craft/` | Design, aesthetics, visual tools, branding, the art of making |
| `thinking/` | Mental models, worldview shifts, career, identity, the big-picture stuff |
| `_inbox/` | Unsorted drops waiting to be categorized |

## Weekly Digests

Auto-generated summaries in `weekly/` — what I consumed, organized as a learning tree.

## How It Works

1. I find something interesting
2. Chanakya summarizes, categorizes, and files it
3. Git tracks everything — full history of what I've learned and when
