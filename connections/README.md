# Connections

Cross-domain synthesis notes. Each file links ideas from different articles or domains, extracting the shared pattern.

## Format

```markdown
# [Connection Title]

**Links:** 
- [[path/to/article-1]]
- [[path/to/article-2]]

**Pattern:** One sentence describing the isomorphism.

**Synthesis:** Why these ideas connect. What you see when you hold them together that you can't see from either alone.

**Application:** Where else might this pattern apply?
```

## Why This Exists

Consuming information isn't learning. Connecting information is.

This folder is where the generalist compounds — spotting the same structure across domains, building a latticework of mental models that transfer.
