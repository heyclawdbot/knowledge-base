# Obsolescence Is the Constant

**Pattern:** What you build to compensate for today's limitations becomes debt when the limitation disappears — whether it's code or career capital.

## Synthesis

Bustamante writes about *code scaffolding* — the RAG pipelines, vector databases, and prompt engineering that compensates for model limitations. When the next model drops, the scaffolding becomes technical debt.

Hess writes about *career scaffolding* — the specialized skills humans accumulated because deep expertise was the winning strategy. When AI handles execution, that specialization becomes identity debt.

Same structure:
1. A limitation exists (model capability / human bandwidth)
2. You build around it (infrastructure / expertise)
3. The limitation dissolves (better models / AI tools)
4. What you built becomes a liability (technical debt / stranded career capital)

The insight compounds: **the meta-skill is recognizing what's scaffolding and what's foundation**. In code, that means building close to the model and celebrating deletions. In careers, that means investing in synthesis over specialization.

## Application

- **Teams:** Are you hiring specialists or orchestrators? Specialists are scaffolding.
- **Learning:** Am I learning a skill or learning the structure beneath the skill?
- **Products:** Is this feature compensating for a limitation that will disappear?
- **Architecture:** Every abstraction layer is a bet. What are you betting on?
