## Introduction

> **Kristen:** Hi everyone, I'm Kristen Berman and this is The Irrational Mind. This is the first episode in a series of conversations we're going to have with people to understand our irrational mind.
>
> This podcast is for product, marketing, design people — people who want to get inspired to build and grow products that work. And to do that, we're talking to people who really get human behavior.
>
> Yes, you could talk to five users to improve your onboarding, but why not just take the playbook of a game designer? Yes, you could launch and learn your latest marketing campaign, but why not learn from the dog trainer who really understands how to design incentives? Or a magician who understands how to capture our attention?
>
> So we're digging for gold here, and we'll talk to a variety of people and companies to help you grow and build work. And today we're starting by tackling meditation.
>
> What can we learn about getting people to meditate that you could then use in your work and in your life?
>
> Meditation is something I find fascinating. Basically, it's something anyone can do. It requires no advanced degree. You can do it whenever and wherever you want. You don't need gym equipment. You don't need other people. You don't need to pay for it. And people say if you do it, you feel better.
>
> Headspace is the leader in getting people to start meditating, and today we are talking to their VP of Design and Research, Kale Thompson.
>
> But it's so easy and there are so few barriers to entry — why do we need help meditating? Why don't we just do it all the time? In other words, why do we need help, or why do we need Headspace?
>
> Well, we need it because meditation is available whenever. Because meditation is free. Because you can do meditation alone. And because the reward is delayed.
>
> So given all that, it's actually one of the most difficult behaviors you could ever design. In fact, I couldn't imagine a harder habit for people to start.
>
> So what can PMs and marketers learn from Headspace? Well, today we will dive into what they have learned about getting us to do a really hard thing.
>
> So the essence of behavior change — and maybe a secret to innovation — is to make something easier. Think about Amazon Prime or Uber. And we want to make it more motivating. Think about TikTok.
>
> So the aim is to reduce barriers and increase benefits. At the base level, this is how Headspace broke through and built their massively popular meditation platform. They made meditation easier by making it shorter — just 10 minutes. And they ask you to pay, which can increase commitment and motivation. And they also make it a wee bit more immediately gratifying by focusing on use cases for anxiety and sleep.
>
> So Kale Thompson, the head of design and research, will talk about the ways they have improved 7-day and 30-day retention. And I do think Headspace has helped people to start practicing meditation. They have made it easy to start, and honestly, that is not easy. So credit where credit is due — product people, take note.
>
> But the question is continuing. And this is where I'm a little bit skeptical. Headspace says to reduce stress you need to use it at least three times a week for 10 minutes. That may not sound like a lot, but it feels like a lot.
>
> So what is the theory of continuing? You could imagine you could show people other members who are successful and give them aspiration to keep going. Or you could show them failure, so people don't feel so alone if they are also struggling. You could make it really, really easy to start and require zero commitment upfront. Or you could ask for a lot of money and a longer commitment. Do you allow people to use it whenever they want, or do you restrict times and freedom?
>
> So "anywhere, anytime" is clearly not the recipe to help people continue to meditate, or we wouldn't need Headspace. So how far do you go?
>
> Well, I'd be bullish on an app that was even more paternalistic than Headspace. Take my money and my mind, Headspace. Go on, take it.
>
> And on a more personal note, my day job is CEO of Irrational Labs. Irrational Labs is a SWAT team of behavioral scientists. We help companies design and build products that customers use, love, and pay for. This podcast is an exploration of behavior change across different domains.

## What Headspace Knows About Getting People to Meditate

**Kristen:** Headspace is a stress reduction app. It is also well known for meditation, and so today we're going to focus on meditation. And I would be remiss to not start off with the idea that meditation is difficult. It is hard for most humans to do for a variety of reasons we will likely get into.

But maybe you could just kick us off with kind of the big question, which is: what does Headspace know about getting people to meditate?

**Kale:** Yeah, well, we know that it needs to feel palatable and easy and approachable, and it needs to be demystified.

So the early, early kind of origin story of Headspace was that Rich and Andy, who are the co-founders, wanted to demystify meditation and demystify mindfulness. Because it can seem so esoteric, and you know, it's a multi-thousands-year-old tradition.

So what we know is that breaking down the practice of meditation into bite-size lessons and making those available on someone's phone in their pocket is absolutely necessary for people to actually be able to learn that skill.

**Kristen:** Yep, that makes a lot of sense with what we know about behavioral science — taking what we say is the path of least resistance. So basically, if something's hard, we will probably not do it as much as if it's easy.

And so if you tell me I have to meditate for 60 minutes versus 10 versus 2, it's potentially likely that I will be more interested in meditation.

So maybe dive into that — how did you actually make meditation easier? Like, what are the guts behind that?

**Kale:** Yeah, great question. And I wasn't here for that portion of the Headspace history, but when Andy and Rich founded Headspace — which was now 13 years ago — they started off doing live events and they were teaching meditation live, in person, mostly in London.

And then when they transitioned to making it into a digital app, they said, "Okay, so how can we break down these skills into something that is so achievable and approachable and kind of everyday? Like, bring it down to earth — what would that look like?"

And so what they ended up doing was breaking down meditation into eight techniques. So the Basics in Headspace teach you eight techniques — body scan being one of them, visualization, etc.

And then they said, "Okay, for most people, they are not going to be able to sit for meditation for 30 minutes, an hour — the kinds of things that if you go to a meditation class in person, you might do."

So they said, "How can we bring it even more to an approachable level?" And that's where Take 10 came from.

Take 10 was 10 minutes a day of meditation for 10 days. And that was sort of the minimum that Andy Puddicombe felt someone needed to do to learn the basics of meditation.

And in that Take 10 — 10 minutes of meditation for 10 days — they would learn those eight meditation techniques. And there are really wonderful instructive videos that show each technique so that they become less abstract and more concrete. Like, "Hey, this is what it really means to note." Here is a beautiful animated video that actually takes you through that process and uses real-life metaphors that are very easy for anyone to grasp.

And, "This is what it means to be an observer of your thoughts. This is what it means to remember the blue sky." There's just this very simple clarity to each of those little — what we call — Expert Guidance videos.

And so essentially, you start with that Take 10. And then — just to go throwback all the way back to when the app was first founded, because it's a little different now — you went from 10 minutes a day, 10 days in a row, to 15 minutes of meditation a day for 15 days, and then 20 minutes of meditation a day for 20 days. So you're kind of gradually stepping into more of a meditation practice.

---

## Progressive Difficulty vs. Deep-End Approach

**Kristen:** So that seems like a theory of change that basically says: if you can do something kind of hard, then you can do something a little bit more hard, and we're going to kind of progress you along and you'll progressively get to be this Buddha.

The other approach — I know, it's so easy! — the other approach would be what is classically done by many people who are new and see their friends doing it: sign up for a 10-day meditation retreat without having ever meditated, and then just say, "Well, we'll see what happens." And you're basically saying, "I'm going to do the really hard thing up front, and then after that, kind of teach myself or hope that something increases my meditation in my daily life."

So how do you think about those two different theories of change? And I don't know if Headspace does a 10-day meditation sponsored or something, but how should people think about starting?

**Kale:** That's a good — well, just to clarify so I'm answering your question correctly — do you mean like a 10-day Vipassana retreat, where someone is like—

**Kristen:** Exactly. I'm going to just go ahead and sign up for a 10-day silent, you know...

**Kale:** Yeah, we don't actually — though I kind of wish we would — offer in-person retreats. It would be so fun.

It's an interesting — I love where you're going with this. I think Headspace has gone the other way. I think that we see so many people who come to us in states of need that we have realized it's more important to be approachable and welcoming and very easy, in order to help people who are in varying states of duress.

And so, you know, while there are people who use Headspace for the achievement-oriented side of it, there are also plenty of people who come because they're in the middle of the night unable to sleep. We've had members who download the app while having a very panicky response to finding out a loved one is in the hospital.

There's sort of levels of duress that we respond to that require that we have to be much more quick and simple and easy to grok than, "Leave your job for 10 days and go to this retreat center and you're gonna be silent and you may never have done this before, but you're gonna be a better person."

**Kristen:** That's the pitch, exactly!

**Kale:** Exactly, exactly. And you probably will be! But that's not — not everyone is quite there yet. In fact, I'd say half the time I'm not there.

**Kristen:** Yeah, yeah.

## Vitamin vs. Aspirin: Meeting Users at Point of Need

**Kristen:** So you mentioned a nice insight that basically Headspace has kind of moved to a world where you're helping people at the point of need when they come in. So basically you're addressing any kind of acute issue that they have.

Can you talk more about either that evolution or that finding of saying, "You know, in general you want to meditate, but today you want to calm down" — that kind of idea of reducing stress?

**Kale:** Yeah, and this is the origin story of the SOS meditations that are in the Headspace app.

Over time, we realized there were people who were not necessarily coming in to learn meditation — that is one mental model for sure, there are people who do that — and then there are people who come in because they're having a more immediate need.

And so we call it at Headspace the "vitamin versus the aspirin."

We have people who come in and they need an aspirin — and that's where our SOS series comes in. Some of the great sleep SOSes that are in our sleep section of the app — there's one called "Waking Up at Night" and one that's "Pain in the Night" — things that are more of an aspirin type, an immediate need.

And then the vitamin crew, the vitamin users, are folks who are coming in actively to learn meditation and are much, much happier to go through the Basics One, Two, and Three, and do different courses on different topics like creativity or performance at work, things like that.

**Kristen:** So maybe it seems like those are two different types of users — "I'm going to learn meditation" or "I'm going to really solve a problem that I have right now."

In behavioral science, we did — we kind of call it present bias, which is like: today I want to do something. My future self wants to be a better person and meditate every day, but today I need help, I need something.

And so maybe the stress reduction is kind of like that — you're solving the thing they actually need today.

How do you think about the retention in general, and this focus on 7 days versus 30 days versus forever?

**Kale:** What we have found over the course of especially the last three years in the Headspace app is that when folks come in, we have a relatively short window to explain to them either how to use the Headspace app or how to use it for different need states.

Especially that first 7 days is valuable. But we've also noticed the first 14 days is valuable. And then the high need for guidance ends around day 30. So that's just what we've noticed from looking at our member base.

What we have experimented with is: in that first 7 days, how can we give people more grounding on what is in our content library? What are the types of things that you could work on — sleep, movement, mindful eating, stress, anxiety, meditation and mindfulness?

We've created a series of videos called "How to Headspace" that are wonderful — the content team made them — but they're really guiding people on how can you use this, and what are the different components of this overall app that could help you based on different need states.

---

## The 30-Day Diary Study

**Kale:** And then in that first 30 days — just to broaden out the frame — once we started studying that 30 days at depth and really looking at members...

We actually did an incredible diary study on this where we had 25 people track their experience with Headspace for 30 days and give us very honest feedback throughout. It was just a fabulous research study that our design research team did.

I highly recommend that to anyone working in product — get your design research teams to do this — because it showed us kind of the other side of what was happening for members in the app.

**Kristen:** What was one insight from that?

**Kale:** Oh, I have — we have hundreds. There's so many.

The big insight was: people needed more concrete guidance in that first 30 days, and they needed it more in a step-by-step mechanism.

And so what it led to was our 30-Day Managing Stress program, which is now live in the Headspace app. Kanga is the teacher on that one.

What we realized is that people needed daily actions that were related to using the Headspace app and to their need state. And then they also needed a sense of reward — which I'm sure you as a behavioral scientist could tell us, that's exactly what people would need.

They needed a sense of completion. Like, "I've done this action. Great, the system is saying check, you've done it. Now I move on to the next activity in my day as part of this managing stress program. And then tomorrow I have different activities."

It's a very sequential journey. So that diary study showed us the level of guidance that people needed.

## Measuring Success: Content Starts, Completes, and Daily Active Use

**Kristen:** So how do you guys study if this actually works in the app? Are you doing an A/B test? Is it a slow rollout? What's the method to study if this stuff actually drives retention across the board?

**Kale:** Yeah. We track content starts and content completes — that's one of our big metrics. And we also track daily active use — like, how many times has this person come back and used the app?

And when we rolled out the Managing Stress program, we did notice not only an increase in content starts and content completes, but also in daily active use — people coming back.

I'd say the golden amount for a Headspace member is 3 or 4 daily active uses — or days active in a week. That's really the amount that someone not only uses in order to retain as a member, become a subscriber, renew their subscription — but also, and I think this is really important because it is a little different for Headspace than other apps, **reduces their stress**.

Like, it actually has to — we actually measure that in the app. When folks are filling out a monthly perceived stress score survey in the profile, in order to actually reduce their stress, our external evidence base that we've worked on with external collaborators shows us that really people need to meditate **at least 10 minutes a day, three times a week** in order to get measurable stress reduction.

And so that daily active use, those content plays — yeah, they're helpful in terms of product mechanics, product engagement. But as far as health outcomes, they're also quite vital.

It's like: it won't actually work for you and it won't give you the benefits that you want to get unless you actually use it.

---

## Run Streaks and Breathing Exercises

**Kristen:** Okay, so we've got basically: make it easy — move from long meditations to 10-minute ones. We've got maybe lead with an aspirin or pain reduction sort of thing, like stress, to get people in the door and interested. And then we have this idea of step-by-step guiding people, saying, "Here's the way to do it so you're not lost," and maybe you have some checkboxes to feel good about.

What other things work to keep people going during the 7 days and past the 7 days?

**Kale:** Great question. I'll give you two important ones.

So we do have a run streak, and it's been in the Headspace app for a very long time. It surfaces after your meditation — there's a little end card that gives you a tick, "You did it," you see your run streak update, and there's a little mindful quote that kind of sends you on into your day. And then that run streak is also visible to the member in their profile.

Now, I will sidebar to say: we got a lot of member feedback about the run streak over the years. And so our designers, being the human-centered designers they are, listened to that feedback. They actually have a feature now in the profile where you can show and hide the run streak.

For people who feel that it is overly gamifying the practice of meditation and mindfulness, or they don't want their mental health tools to be gamified — which, fully understand, that's a valid user type — they have the ability. There's a little icon and they can show or hide that feature. And people use it.

Now, the other thing in the first 7 days that we found to be really useful — and this sounds wild — is to break down meditation that's already short into something even simpler.

We did notice that for some people, the very idea of eyes-closed, seated meditation — even in the way that Headspace teaches it, which is, you don't have to be sitting lotus style on the floor, you don't have to be in a monastery, you could be in your office, you could be in your home, whatever, sitting in a chair — even that was a bit intimidating for some people.

And so we broke it down even further to: what is the bare minimum tiny step that you could do that is a step towards being able to sit for a meditation?

And that is a **breathing exercise**.

So the very top of what we call our Dynamic Playlist — which is on the Today tab in the Headspace app, on the home screen — the very top is a breathing exercise. And that refreshes every day, it's different every day. But it's the first activity in that to-do list on the Today tab.

Because it's so simple, you get this little dopamine hit of achievement from doing it. You not only feel a little bit better, but you also have achieved something that then you can kind of move into the next items on the list — which in order are a video, like a daily video, and then the daily meditation — in a posture of "I've already accomplished something."

That was what we really noticed needed to happen in the first 7 days. And we're still experimenting with changing some of that with the breathing exercises. But that proved to be a very valuable way for especially our brand-new members to get into the practice of meditation without it being too intimidating.

**Kristen:** Yeah, that's very nice. You're basically taking 10 minutes and mushing it into 20 seconds and saying, "Look, this is kind of foot in the door" — which is this idea that if you do one small thing, maybe you'll do more. And starting with breathing.

---

## Eyes-Open Meditation

**Kristen:** Can you talk a little bit about the open eyes idea that you've started to do?

**Kale:** Yeah, thanks for bringing that up.

We have now — in part from qualitative member feedback and then part just from looking at the quantitative metrics and our product data — noticed that people are gravitating towards video more. So that's the quant side.

And then the qual side: we've had members, for varying reasons — some of them prior trauma, some of them from intimidation factor around meditation — who have said, "I don't really feel comfortable sitting with my eyes closed. Are there more eyes-open activities that I could do? Because as soon as I close my eyes, I have feelings that I would rather not address, or things that come up, or things are just really uncomfortable, or I don't feel safe in my physical environment," etc.

So what we did is created more eyes-open meditation. They're kind of these visual meditations.

Especially Rosie Acosta and Dora Kamau, two of our meditation teachers, have some beautiful ones in our National Parks collection. They guide you on a walk through nature. And so there is a calming benefit to that, the way a meditation would operate for you, but there isn't that added — what can be really uncomfortable for some people — practice of needing to close your eyes in order to get that benefit.

---

## Long-Term Users and Expertise

**Kristen:** So it seems like the app has kind of lowered the barrier — the psychological and logistical barrier — to doing this. But there have to be people out there who are just good at meditating.

We all have the friends who are like, they wouldn't do an app, they would just do it. They're just better than all of us.

So what have you learned about these outliers, or folks who have figured something out about the practice of meditation, that potentially could be applied to the rest of us?

**Kale:** Yeah, that's a great question.

What we've observed in our long-term members — folks who have been using Headspace for 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, some since the origin, 12 years, 13 years — is that because they've built a habit or a practice of meditation and mindfulness, they're really comfortable with that.

So then they move into wanting more insights and more wisdom traditions. Things like the Longtime Academy, which is a really wonderful podcast and guided mindful practices series that's in the Headspace app.

It's sort of like they have now created a habit of meditating and have relative ease there, but now they kind of want to deepen the insights that they're gaining from it.

So we have the Pro level course, which is for that. There's a couple levels of the Pro course, and they're semi-guided and even unguided — which is essentially a timer for people who are very advanced and just want the companionship of the app, but don't necessarily need all the verbal guidance. The verbal guidance actually becomes a bit of a distraction for them.

What's also important to bring up is that we have noticed from a lot of our different research that people come to Headspace for meditation. And often, the more that they do meditation, they gain so much more present-moment awareness and awareness of how they are feeling — in this moment and then in general in their lives — that they start to realize they have other things that they want to work on.

And that's why we have coaching, therapy, psychiatry coming into our overall ecosystem. It's available right now to our Enterprise members, but coming soon in different forms for our consumer members.

People come in, they start to get present with how they're feeling — which meditation and mindfulness does, increasing your present-moment awareness — and then they realize, "Huh, I'm actually really anxious, or I'm really stressed out, or I actually have a feeling of sadness. I wonder what this is."

And from there, meditation actually becomes a bit of a gateway into more deep personal work. "Okay, now I really want to handle these things that have existed in my past for a long time that I've never really felt comfortable handling, or that I wasn't even quite aware were bugging me. And now that I'm more present, more settled, more here, more aware in my daily life, I'm realizing there's something I want to work on here."

And so that's where — we even saw it in that 30-day diary study — people say, "I actually could use some human support."

---

## Habit Stacking: The Prescription for Consistent Meditation

**Kristen:** It's a nice observation on expertise — if you get to be an expert at something, you continue to be curious about ways to better yourself. So if you're a professional athlete, you're constantly still thinking about ways to improve your form and make small adjustments.

And so it's possible that maybe what keeps folks going as they start is the possibility of getting even better, or evolving. Like, it is kind of a ladder where folks are moving up — you practice, you see the results, and you want to practice a little bit more.

Do you think that is fair — that expertise is like you're becoming a little bit more curious about yourself? And if that's the case, then how would we apply that to folks who are beginning?

I'm someone who has given up many times. I have downloaded multiple meditation apps and have failed. And so I'm trying to think — would the intervention for me be to maybe get a little bit more curious about myself? Or how would you prescribe an intervention to someone like myself, who — I hope I'm not alone — has given up multiple times?

**Kale:** You're not alone. You're not alone, not at all.

In fact, we see this behavioral pattern in our data where often people will download Headspace, they will use it for a while, and then they sort of disappear. And then they come back. And then they disappear. And they come back.

And what it often — just to give you this because I think you'll enjoy this — what it often coincides with are life events.

Something will happen in their life where they realize they need deeper support — whether that's a relationship ending, a job ending, getting pregnant is a big one — these being sort of like life-stage transformation moments. And then they re-download the app or re-sign up because they're like, "Ooh, I need coaching and guidance through this phase. All my previous skills worked for me for where I was, but now that I'm faced with this new challenge, I need some new coping skills and new guidance and new support."

So there's that.

But okay, here's what I would prescribe as an intervention to your need state:

This is where the user behavior of **habit stacking** or creating anchors that are reminders comes in.

What we've seen in successful — it's weird to call someone a "successful Headspace user" — but people who have formed a habit with Headspace, what we have seen is that they often pair it with something else that they do daily.

Andy Puddicombe used to recommend: "Hey, pair this with brushing your teeth. You wake up in the morning, you brush your teeth — let that be the anchor or the cue that then leads you into your morning meditation."

We've also seen members who pair it with morning exercise. An example of that would be someone taking their running shoes and putting those by the door, and putting their meditation chair — the chair that they meditate in — by the window. And then creating this habit stack in the morning of: going first to the meditation chair, doing their meditation, and then going and putting their running shoes on and going out the door for their morning run.

There are a lot of examples like that. But I would anchor it to a behavior you are already doing, because that's what makes it easier.

You're not going to not brush your teeth in the morning — well, for most of us — and so that being kind of your little mental pinpoint. Like, "Okay good, I did that. Oh, what's next? Ah, now I'm gonna get some Headspace. I'm gonna take 10 or 15 or 20, whatever it is for that person."

**Kristen:** Nice. And what I like about that example is also the redesign of the environment. So this person — this mythical creature who does all the things, but probably is a real person — changed her bedroom environment. She has the chair next to her bed.

And so you could imagine a world where you'd have to go upstairs or downstairs, and maybe in that time in between you just forget. Like, in product design, if you add an extra field, people drop off. It's like, "That's crazy! What, did you get distracted?" It's like, "We had you!"

And so having maybe your meditation thing on a different floor or farther from where you'll be actually could be this barrier. And having the chair there potentially could be a trigger to remember and to do the thing. So that's very nice — changing your environment to change your behavior.

**Kale:** I think so.

## Attention as a Commodity

**Kale:** We live in a world where attention itself has become a commodity, and everything is vying for your attention. There are a lot of apps that are monetized based on how much they can capture and keep your attention.

And Headspace is pretty unusual in that our explicitly stated goal is to **give you more command and control over your own attention**.

That is pretty unusual in the world of product design. The "hooked" mentality is: get people in and keep them in for as long as possible. And that is absolutely the opposite at Headspace.

At Headspace, our intention is: get in for what you need, for you to feel better, and then get off of the app and go live your life.

And that's why for us, daily active days is a more important measurement, or content plays — but not minutes in the app. We would not ever measure that because that would actually defeat the purpose of what we are doing.

So there's something a little unusual and a bit weird about that, but that's our different mentality.

**Kristen:** Yes. So it's not time spent, but it is opening something. And lovely — it aligns with the user's goals.

Just like Peloton can want you to get back in the app, but that's good because you do want to exercise. That's the goal of you signing up for the app. And so you have this beautiful alignment of business and user intentions.

But how do you bring folks back to the app? What's the reminder strategy that you guys have figured out?

---

## Notification Strategy

**Kale:** Yeah, we have a couple.

We have a **Daily Mindful Moment**, which is a notification that someone gets to their lock screen that has a very lovely insight, a little wisdom moment. So it's a nice reminder both of some of the kinds of insights you have when you're doing meditation and mindfulness, and also just a little bit of a breather in the day. When you get it, you kind of go, "Oh, that's really lovely."

We have that, and then we also have little notifications and reminders that we'll send to people from our internal lifecycle team that are around different topics that that person has been interested in.

So if we have a new Sleepcast — which is our sleep stories — and this is someone who has used sleep content a lot in the past, we can send a little, "Hey, we actually have this new..." You know, I'm talking about our National Park partnership a lot because I'm kind of obsessed with it, but, "We have a new Sleepcast in Joshua Tree."

Or for our kids and parents, "We have a new Sesame Street Elmo sleep story" — which are very beloved.

So these reminders based on your interest become really important. It's actually connecting with: why is someone here? What are the topics they're interested in? What are the obvious need states or areas of their overall health that they're clearly wanting to work on, if they're doing sleep content predominantly, or meditation?

And then aligning those notifications and reminders to them, so they're tailored to what a person is doing versus just a generic, "Hey, you forgot to come back to the app" — which we again never do.

**Kristen:** This is really nice. Because meditation — and I'm gonna, forgive me if I offend you — has no benefit in the beginning. It takes a while.

I'm sure having a deep breath is going to be good, but as you said, you need to come back, you need to do it about three times a week for 10 minutes to really feel some sustained stress reduction.

And so you kind of have to give people some benefit to do a thing if they're going to do the thing.

And so I like the notification strategy that's paired with — and it's obvious in hindsight but probably not obvious to most teams — paired with the interest, the thing that they are most curious about, that they have expressed an interest to dive deeper in.

And if they can't actually achieve that outcome of stress reduction yet, at least they're learning on it and exploring it and making that association that meditation could, in theory in the future if they do it, work for them in the interest that they're focused on.

So I'm sure that probably wasn't as obvious to the content team in the beginning, but it seems obvious now that of course you should pair a notification with some interest, especially for a product that has delayed benefits.

**Kale:** Yeah. Well, and also — here's what I'll say about meditation: it actually does have immediate benefits.

What we have found is that people do actually feel better. Most of our users feel better right away from doing that first meditation. There is an immediate value of that sense of relaxation and their nervous system coming down, landing a little bit.

It's not necessarily something that sustains though, just from one session. Where it becomes really important to create a habit is: How are you then able to respond more resiliently in times of stress? For your actual measurable stress levels to come down to a degree that is actually substantial — those require creation of a habit.

But for most people — I will say not for everyone, but for most people — there is an immediate sense of calming that happens just from one session.

**Kristen:** I get an immediate benefit from being able to tell people that I meditated. I'm like, "I just did this thing!" And that makes me feel good to tell you.

**Kale:** That's brilliant, honestly. That's probably a user type that we should be studying. Oh my God, I mean, that mentality.

**Kristen:** Yeah! Or the idea that basically meditation is tough because it's by yourself.

And it is funny that folks pay to go to a 10-day meditation retreat to sit in silence — because you could do that by yourself. But intuitively we know that that's really difficult to sit for 10 days by yourself. So you're putting yourself in a situation with other people that kind of creates the norm that other people are doing this.

It's this conundrum that meditation is very solo and yet it kind of has to involve other people to make it seem either more real or create an identity for you that could sustain the beginning, at least, before you have that habit-stacking magic.

## Showing Progress Over Time

**Kristen:** So Headspace is in a category of products where the benefit can be delayed — where in the future people will see a benefit, and today they may not see as much of a benefit as tomorrow.

So how do you help them understand the future benefit, or at least acknowledge that it could be coming?

**Kale:** It's a good question.

What we do to acknowledge the future benefit — and that it may take a little while to get the big feeling results that you're hoping for — is, well, we do many things. But the key one I'd love to talk about is:

In the Profile in the Headspace app, we have a section called **My Progress**.

In that feature, we allow people to do a self-reported measure on stress — the PSS — and a self-reported measure of their anxiety — the GAD-7.

The anxiety survey they can fill out once every two weeks. The stress survey they can fill out once a month.

And then we nudge people in the app — we have a little modal that comes up that says, "Hey, it's time to do your monthly stress check-in. Would you like to do it now, or would you like to be reminded later?" And they can choose one of two options.

If they do it now, they fill out those 10 questions, and then they have the option to write a little journal entry at the end. That is essentially a reminder to themselves of why they were feeling that way that month.

And what this allows is for people to see their change over longer spans of time.

I would say a very important part of meditation and mindfulness and working on one's mental health is: there is real value to zooming out and looking at your life from a longer span of time, versus this quick-quick-quick-quick immediacy that the modern world loves to funnel us into.

To have these moments to zoom out and go, "Oh wow, my stress was really high that month. Wow, it was really high in July. What was going on there?" And then you can read your journal entry and see, "That was when a loved one was sick," or whatever happened.

Or, "Oh wow, it was lower there. Well, that's interesting, because that's when I started meditating every day. So there's some correlation between what I was doing and how I was feeling."

And I think what's really grounding about having that stress score and the anxiety score is that you're actually **quantifying something that can feel so nebulous and so messy and so confusing**.

Like, "I don't know, am I making progress? I don't know, am I less stressed out this month than last month? I don't know." So to actually see it — it's cool.

**Kristen:** And it's kind of a problem that you, I would imagine, face at the brand level. It's really hard for me to detect that this small change in my behavior drove me to feel less stressed out on an average basis.

It's hard for humans to attribute this. Like, "I meditate now 10 minutes a day" — but I mean, you could have changed your walk to work, or you could have started dating somebody new. There's lots of things in the environment.

So I do like this idea of having you guys take more credit. Basically saying, "Okay, I'm going to get to reflect, but also this — we are a part of that story" — versus maybe they attribute it just purely to themselves. We tend to take more credit than we deserve.

## Paying to Meditate: Free vs. Premium

**Kristen:** So feel free to punch into this if you want, but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about what you've learned about paying to meditate.

The premium mental model versus — at this stage of the game, I think there's almost no real free meditations, maybe a few. But 90% of the meditations or sleep or stress are going to be behind a paywall.

Tell me about that process and that decision.

**Kale:** Yeah, it's a great question.

When we first experimented with changing the way that our free versus premium model worked, a big part of it was around the confusing nature of our different subscription types.

It was actually very confusing in the product. "Do I have a free membership? Do I not? There's quite a lot of free content here for me, so maybe I do have a paid subscription. But I don't have access to everything, so why is that?" — because we had elements that were free and elements that weren't.

Now, almost everything is behind the paywall. But we are actually experimenting with changing some of that.

What we noticed though — and I think this will be very relevant to you and the topic of behavior — is that **for people who were paying, that was a much higher degree of utilization of the app**.

And this is obvious in hindsight, I guess, but it felt new to us when we were researching it.

People who paid had much more active days. They were much more consistent in their use of the app because they had a sense of financial accountability to use it.

For people who could afford to pay for it, they were using it. That payment was kind of their stake in the ground to say, "I'm going to do this. I'm going to invest in feeling better. I'm going to invest in myself, my mental health and well-being. And I'm going to actually use this."

And I'll give you some data on this because I think it's interesting:

What we have noticed amongst our users who are what we call B2B or Enterprise users — who are getting it covered as a benefit through work — they have **much lower active days, much lower utilization**.

Because to them, it's a free thing. It's like, "Who cares?" It becomes a nice-to-have versus someone who has invested in it and said, "This is something I want to pay for because I want to make sure I'm doing this habit, and I want to start to feel better, or I want to learn this practice of meditation."
