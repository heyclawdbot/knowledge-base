## Key Insights (from the episode)

- **Remove rewards for small actions** — patting users on the head for every little thing removes the satisfaction of real achievement
- **Add good friction** — making things too easy means users don't learn what "right" looks like
- **Kids skip 100% of text boxes** — teaching through play beats teaching through instructions
- **Daily resets + leaderboards** — the 7:30pm reset created a shared coordination moment
- **Silly hats matter** — cosmetic rewards with no utility still drive engagement
- **Three hearts, not twenty** — simpler state = more comprehensible = feels like your fault when you fail

## Introduction

> **Kristen:** Hi everyone, I'm Kristen Berman and this is The Irrational Mind.
>
> As behavioral scientists, our job is basically to get people to do hard things — things like saving money, eating better, calling your doctor, or avoiding the scroll.
>
> As you likely know, this is tough. Yes, I want to optimize my savings account interest rate, but today I want to go to brunch with friends and play some video games.
>
> So who better to learn about motivation than a game designer?
>
> And today we get into the heads of Joel Beardsley and Dan Vader. These guys are all-stars in the game design industry. They've designed and developed numerous games, but for our purposes, we are going to zero in on Grindstone — one of the most satisfying puzzle games in recent memory. Dan was the lead writer and designer, and Joel was studio director at Capybara Games.
>
> I went into the conversation thinking we would talk about the classic gamification mechanics like points and gems and streaks. But instead, we talked about the benefits of *not* awarding those types of kudos and points — and in their case, hearts — and making the game harder, not easier. This, they said, has helped unlock users' motivation.
>
> In our society, it seems like we have two versions of motivation:
>
> One paradigm emphasizes tangible rewards — money, allure, affirmation. These are the motivators, and these motivators are often mirrored in gaming through points and gems and streaks. We literally call this "gamification."
>
> The other motivation paradigm says big challenges motivate me. I want to climb a mountain. This feels heavy and hard, but it feels worth it in the end.
>
> We typically see these models of motivation as very different. But Joel and Dan introduced me to a more nuanced perspective on motivation — suggesting a more authentic interpretation of gamification, one that blends the thrill of conquest with the satisfaction of overcoming formidable challenges.
>
> Here, the pursuit is not driven by the allure of rewards, but by the intrinsic value of the challenge itself — with rewards serving merely as a nudge to persist, rather than the primary motivator.
>
> To be clear, Joel and Dan would never suggest removing hearts and daily challenges and leaderboards. These are critical. But they may be less critical than the underlying feeling of accomplishment someone gets in doing a hard thing.
>
> We hit it all in our conversation. We touch on leaderboards and their point of view on onboarding. They share an example of one feature that didn't work and one that did. We touch on the beauty of coordination — hello, 7:30 Eastern — and why silly hats really matter.
>
> There's so much to unpack with these guys, so settle back in your favorite gaming chair and enjoy.
>
> And on a more personal note, my day job is CEO of Irrational Labs. Irrational Labs is a SWAT team of behavioral scientists.

## The Conceptual Genesis of Grindstone

**Kristen:** Guys, thanks for joining. Very excited.

I did not — this is my confession before we start, just so you know where I'm coming from — I watched a lot of videos of people playing games, but I did not go as deep as I should have in this homework. But I now understand how to watch videos of people playing video games, so I feel like I understand my husband a little bit more. So thank you for that therapy.

So you guys are expert game developers and you make things interesting and entertaining for a large group of folks. And I think you understand some of the mechanisms that drive people.

Today we're going to focus not generically on all games you've done, but actually zero in on Grindstone — one game that you've collaborated together on. So maybe the first kind of scene-setting for folks is: walk us through what's the conceptual genesis of Grindstone and the initial idea behind it.

**Dan:** So the basic game is a color-matching puzzle game, but we're giving it the aesthetic of an animated action game.

What you're doing is playing a character — his name is Jorj, he's this kind of hulking barbarian in this brutal, icy, unforgiving world. The levels are a 7x7 grid, and your sole mechanic, your sole interaction as the player, is to plot a path from Jorj through like-colored monsters that we call "creeps" — and try to get the longest chain that you can.

You can be very contemplative and cerebral about it. You can take your time — there is no timer, there is no time pressure. And then you plot that path, you hit go, and you unleash Jorj on this murderous rampage through all the creeps, slashing and just throwing gore on the screen.

The higher the chain you can create, you can unleash these things called Grindstones — which is the primary resource in the game. It's a shiny crystal, a classic gaming trope. When you do that, it's a rainbow crystal that allows you to both collect it as your prime resource in the world, but also switch colors to make even longer murderous chains through the level.

So that's the basic interaction — just plotting these color-matching chains of destruction through the level while playing this barbarian.

But our little twist on it was that we didn't want to make a game that was, you know, machismo, testosterone-driven, typical barbarian game about some epic mythical quest. We wanted to boil it down to something that was infinitely relatable, even to ourselves while we were making the game.

Which was: this is your job. Jorj is perhaps not passionate about killing creeps every day. He's doing it to support his family. He wakes up every morning, it's snowy outside every day — just like it is right now — he punches the clock, and he goes to work.

We felt like that was a really nice twist on this world and a way to bring players into this fantastical world. And then of course the simple mechanic — the sheer joy of chaining, there's not a lot of rules that govern it, it's very intuitive to the player — and that's the thing that kind of drives them to the next level and the next level.

That's the basic rules. On top of that, we do what we've done really successfully in all of our puzzle offerings, which is: we take those puzzle mechanics and we put it inside this actual world, this lush place with its own history and lore — which is not typical at all for this genre.

And we cast the player as a character with motivations, with familial connections — which is also not typical. Usually in a color-matching puzzle game, there is no character. The main character is the tip of your finger or whatever.

And then on top of that formula, we're just constantly reinventing the game as it goes. We're throwing more and more ideas at that central mechanic to reinvigorate it, to keep the player wondering, "What's next? I want to see what's next."

And that was the Grindstone formula that we lit on.

**Kristen:** Love it. I love the "chain of destruction." So the goal is to get longer and longer chains — murderous chains of destruction.

And so you mentioned that you're adding things to keep people engaged. After they've gotten the basics — which seem to be, you're creating chains that need to be longer, you are Jorj — what are the types of things that are added to keep them going, to keep them wanting to play again?

**Dan:** At its most basic, the meat-and-potatoes level progression takes you on this journey. Most puzzle games — and we adhere to the trope — the level content is spread across a vast spine that moves vertically up. Next level, next level, next level.

The difference is that at every threshold, we're introducing a whole new aspect of the world, a whole new biome, a whole new place with its own enemies and its own sort of little implied environmental story there.

So just playing the levels, you're going to go on this pretty long epic journey that takes you to a lot of different places. You're going to see a lot of different things.

With that, of course, we want to drip new rewards, new pieces of gear, new twists to the mechanic — so that even an expert by level 20 has to be put on their back heels and become an expert again at level 30, and then at level 50, and level 100.

And then on top of that, we were lucky enough to start dipping our toes into this idea of live service — of supporting a game ongoing. We started adding more and more content. And Joel was certainly a part of that process that we were learning as we went.

Maybe Joel can talk about some of that stuff.

---

## Live Service: Learning to Update a Game Post-Launch

**Joel:** Yeah, because I came on in November of 2019, which was like two months after the game shipped — three months, I think.

**Dan:** Right, September 19, 2019.

**Joel:** And it was interesting, right? Capybara had built this really compelling, surprisingly big puzzle game. It launched with Apple Arcade, and it was obvious that the game was worth continuing to invest in. The game was great, the audience was responding to it. It was lauded over and over again as one of the best games in that service, and it had been kind of a dark horse among a really strong catalog of games.

So the question then became: not just how do we incentivize our most committed players, but how do we incentivize players to return to the game, stick with the game? How do we make the experience better and better for new players?

And this — if you follow, I'm guessing, Kristen, from other guests you have on the podcast — the concept of SaaS, or software as a service, is just so dominant in Bay Area software companies. That's a familiar concept that has bled into games as well.

So when Dan says "live service," that's basically SaaS — or GaaS, games as a service. A lot of GaaS concepts will come up.

This stuff was completely foreign to Capybara, despite being a really storied studio with a strong legacy. It was just not a place that Capy had ever really spent any time — updating a game after it had been launched to an audience.

So that was kind of, for me coming on when I did, puzzle number one to sort out: how do we continue to expand the game?

Initially, we had what I would call pretty conventional ideas. Like, "Hey, we'll add new areas with new levels, and we'll kind of repeat the format — continue doing all the solid game design stuff Dan is talking about, adding new enemies or new challenges and new puzzles, so we can continue recombining elements and introducing new elements."

And I think what was interesting was, over time, cracking the code of what were the best kinds of updates to give players to keep them engaged in this more ongoing live game.

Because, I mean, Dan — I've been away from Capy for a little bit now, but Grindstone is still getting updates right now, correct? Like four years on?

**Dan:** Yeah, it is exactly. We just celebrated its four-year anniversary, which is kind of mind-blowing to us — to celebrate an anniversary of a game that we're actually still kind of working on. It's a milestone for the company and something we're really, really proud of.

---

## What Didn't Work: Boss Blitz

**Kristen:** And what were some of those updates? By the way, congrats on the milestone. What were some of the updates that you tried out?

Let's go with the ones that didn't work, or you didn't think worked. I know you may not have the full data set on this, but ones that you tried and didn't actually work. And then we'll go with the ones that actually kind of hit.

**Joel:** Which one do you want to take, Dan?

**Dan:** Because the funny thing about the ones that didn't work — I can think of one that I don't... I wouldn't say it didn't work, but it maybe wasn't as successful as others. Those things still live in the game. It's not like we ripped these things out because they didn't work. They're still there to find and discover for players.

So I'm thinking of what we call the Boss Blitz.

Again, unlike most color-matching puzzle games, our game has a lot of hardcore video game bosses you have to defeat using that puzzling mechanic. They're full of a lot of character and charm, they're pretty zany, they offer this really action-packed twist to the mechanic, and you encounter them all throughout the game.

So we decided to offer a mode for sort of the more — for lack of a better word — hardcore players in the game to try to beat all of those bosses sandwiched together in one run. And then have a leaderboard for how quick did you do it — what's the quickest, fewest amount of turns and time that you could defeat all of these bosses.

I would say it was less successful. One, because that's a pretty steep challenge. But I think my intuition — and it's something we still fight with in the game — is that I think it's less successful because we present it diegetically.

So most games that have modes would show you those modes in a menu. You pull up the game and it says, "Which mode do you want to play?" next to Options and Credits. "Do you want to play two-player? Do you want to play this?"

We're really all about world-building and character at the studio — maybe in this case to a bit of a fault. We love to ground these mechanics inside the world and present them in the voice of the game.

So that mode, Boss Blitz, is not available in a menu. You have to find it in the second biome of the mountain. It's got a little character that introduces it.

And I think because of that, some people probably just missed it. And that's something we're trying to think about differently — because we work hard on this content and we want players to obviously see it. And if they're not seeing it, the lack of engagement might not be down to "they don't like it." They might not know it even exists.

**Kristen:** Totally. If you could redo that one and have a better opt-in, how would you redo it?

**Dan:** Yeah, I mean I would go a little more capital-V Video Games and have a sort of landing menu at the beginning of the game that said, "Which experience do you want? Do you want to play the game proper, continue your progress? Do you want to play The Daily Grind modes — which I think is a success story that Joel can mention next — or do you want to play this Boss Blitz?"

And just foreground that decision right away, and let players choose from there.

**Kristen:** We call this "forced choice," where we make people choose a thing. And it turns out that if you get their attention, most of the time they'll choose something versus not choose.

## What Worked: The Daily Grind

**Kristen:** Joel, tell us about Daily Grinds.

**Joel:** I'm gonna talk about Boss Blitz real quick first, because there might be a little fake-out here. I did the original prototype of Boss Blitz, so maybe I'm rushing to defend my baby here.

Dan's actually right about everything.

So when I first prototyped Boss Blitz, part of the impetus was: hey, we have all these great boss fights in the game, and it would be pretty — and I'm not a programmer, I'm not the most technical person on that team at all — so the framing was, "Hey, it would actually be really easy to prototype this and repurpose content into this mode."

And there's this known thing in games, which is: vanishingly few players reach the end of any game. Particularly when I worked at one larger, really data-driven company — we knew the redemption rates on certain types of content and the completion rates on certain types of content. I mean, you're talking about fractions of a single-digit percentage of your audience that are going to actually reach this type of content.

So we did know categorically, in some ways, that Boss Blitz was like a bad choice — in terms of, a lot of players are not going to see this content.

And my rationale at the time was: it shouldn't be too hard for us to make this — (this is the flash-forward narrator voice) — it was actually hard to make. But we can do this as a fan service for our most hardcore fans, to give them something, show an offering to them.

We also kind of like being proportional about the investment into it. And of course, the investment into it was quite a lot more, because — to Dan's point — we really like doing things diegetically, immersing it in the world. And there's a lot of fit and trim and polish that came with that, which — furthering Dan's point — probably just served to further and further bury this thing that we should have been spotlighting and making part of an onboarding process or just the menu flows for the game.

So definitely lessons learned there that I have full faith and belief that Dan and the team at Capy are able to learn from and apply in future projects.

Now, to take the flip side of the coin that was offered here — probably the big success story is **The Daily Grind modes**.

This was a thing that we had introduced — Dan, I want to say July of 2020? So 6-10 months after launch of the game.

This was a time where we had seen that the retention of the game — the number of players continuing to play the game after day 3, 7, 15, 30 — was exceptional. This was one of the only pieces of data that we actually gathered, in contrast to a lot of other mobile game developers.

So we saw the retention of the game was good and were interested in how we could serve players better. Is adding more content at the end a good idea? Again, we know players don't tend to reach the end of games. Can we offer players something different and a good diversion, and maybe something that fit into people's lifestyles a bit better?

So the idea of a daily leaderboard — which is by no means a revolutionary concept — 24 hours, wipe the slate, new set of levels, new leaderboard, play these levels.

And we were able to populate it. It's four levels, right, Dan? The initial Daily Grind mode was a four-level run?

**Dan:** Four.

**Joel:** And one of the things I think we got right about this too was: those four levels were completely agnostic to your general progression of the game. Which means it might grab level 201 even if you've only progressed to level 10 of the game. It didn't care.

So it took a lot of the programmatic logic — we didn't have to build complex barriers for different players. Anyone in the Grindstone community logs in, if they've unlocked this mode (which you unlock four levels into the game), you can access it. And you'll see content that you wouldn't be able to see normally unless you've invested many hours.

So it made that experience richer. It served to kind of advertise stuff — like, "Oh cool, I wonder when I actually get this weapon," or "When do I see that kind of encounter?"

And then it gave players that leaderboard — which, Kristen, because I listened to the show, I know you've had conversations with people about this kind of stuff before and the power of all that.

It was also our first comeback mechanic, I want to say. A comeback mechanic is anything that sits on a timer.

For people really familiar with mobile games — Farmville, going back 15 years — was a good early mass-adopted example of this. You plant some crops, those crops take three real-time days to grow, you come back three days later, walk into your Facebook account, harvest your corn, and that's a little bit of the game.

There are really aggressive and cynical versions of comeback mechanics that we see in a lot of other games. We wanted to put a light touch on it.

And yeah, it finally worked really well. We got a nice marketing boost from Apple around the same time — which is not inconsequential in terms of helping — but we saw our retention rates and just general appreciation of the game shot really up.

And because it was a different experience — it wasn't just adding more content, it was adding this sort of sidecar onto the experience of the game — we believe that's part of what made it work.

You now could sort of set the flavor. Is your Grindstone experience progressing that story and existing in that world? Or is your Grindstone experience that your commute on the bus is long enough for you to play this one-level stream, and you come back to it the next day?

---

## How the Daily Grind Actually Works

**Kristen:** So I want to summarize just for folks to make sure.

Basically there's kind of two modes. There's this normal progression through — you're on level 19, trying to get to 20, you're doing murderous destruction and want to continue your murderous destruction.

Then there's this Daily Grind, by which you play all — you have four kind of random levels that you're assigned, you're competing with all the players who've chosen to do this Daily Grind, and you have to play all four levels within one day to get qualified to get on the leaderboard. At the end of the day, you'd come back and say, "Did I do well? Am I a good player? Did I hit the top of the leaderboard?"

Is that about right, or correct me?

**Joel:** Yeah, that's pretty much it. Yep.

**Kristen:** Nice. So did you see people coming back — they played and then did they immediately check their score, and did they come back later to see how they fared? Like, how did they get the feedback loop of whether they did well today?

**Joel:** As a non-current representative of Capy, I don't think we knew. I think we had an idea. We had some anecdotal data.

For example, one of the members of the team is probably one of our most hardcore, engaged consumers as well. He just plays, loves it, plays it, and knows the other players by screen name. And he's like, "Oh, I wonder how MattyPatty420 got that score." Or, "I saw him refresh it multiple times a day."

I think technically, on other platforms — not actually on mobile — I think we do gather data that can tell us how often somebody comes back and refreshes their score. But we actually didn't know. We relied a lot on user reviews and anecdotal data to give us an idea of what was working.

And then we would do — trying to remember, Dan — I think what we did is some light analysis of just the number of scores submitted. So each user would count for one, even if they came back 10 times. And then we used that to give ourselves an idea of how the mode was performing.

And we actually introduced multiple Daily Grind modes. The 7:30 PM reset is across all modes — all except for Boss Rush, which is permanent.

But then we introduced other modes. There's one called Quick Grind, which is kind of what it says on the tin — designed because the original four-level mode, you could spend an hour clearing it depending on the levels, depending on how fastidious you were about how you played. So we wanted to introduce one that people could play in a really quick turnaround.

Then we could see which ones seemed to get higher engagement. But much deeper than that, we didn't really gather or analyze the data well.

---

## The Leaderboard Problem

**Kristen:** So here's one conundrum that leaderboards face in the non-gaming world, which is: they're more static. That means if you're really good, you'll get on the leaderboard, but most people aren't really good. It's the head of the leaderboard.

And so you kind of have this problem where leaderboards motivate the people who could get on the leaderboard, and maybe 10% below — people who could get on the leaderboard. But if I'm bad, I just don't care about the leaderboard.

Has gaming solved that — trying to motivate people to care about the leaderboard when they're average?

**Dan:** I mean, gaming is a whole — I'm not sure.

We tried to solve this to a certain extent by giving you a reward simply for placing anywhere on the leaderboard. So we gave you a precious resource in the game — gold. For logging a score, it doesn't matter if it's dead last or somewhere in the middle or at the top — you get this resource.

And that was just a friendly way to treat the leaderboard for players.

In terms of games in general, I have that exact same feeling about the games that I play. On the leaderboards, I don't care.

But you engage. There's something about — I was just playing Grindstone before we started this, one of The Daily Grind modes. And there is just... because of the nature of the modes, they're throwing a lot of different variables at you every 24 hours.

At least for me — and I don't place high, the community is far, far better than me — but because I mean, I made these levels, you know, there's always a chance. If the right combinatorial variety hits that day, maybe I can get into the top 20. Maybe.

And that keeps me coming back, just personally. Because it's not like being the best at a first-person shooter, where really that person is always going to be floating at the top because they've got that muscle memory and skill that I just can't compete with.

**Kristen:** That's really nice. So there's some level of variety, and some level of just hope that people can hold onto — because the variety throws things at you that say, "You know, it could work for me today."

**Joel:** Yes.

So when we first introduced the mode, it has a 7:30 PM reset, which is somewhat arbitrarily chosen. But it had to be one reset for all time zones, so we just chose one. There was no idealizing it, we felt.

And what we saw happen was: some people would play early and get the screenshot of them at the top, you know? And then of course, if you're playing at like 6 PM, you're in a more competitive field.

And we partially patched that hole. We added a countdown timer to the reset. And we added push notifications — if you had registered a partial run or score, we'd prompt you: "Hey, do you want to finish your run?"

Stuff like that. But it kind of felt like it didn't matter to people very much. We could have added a whole lot of bells and whistles to make it more robust, and it kind of felt — my instinct on it was it was pretty quickly diminishing returns.

And so the reward, or the fleeting blueprint item for your first play — this stuff worked pretty well.

**Kristen:** Did it have a friends-isolated — it's just the global leaderboard, right?

**Joel:** We never got around to doing a friends leaderboard. It's just the global leaderboard.

But I think a lot of these decisions for the post-launch live-service content — a lot of these features we made, in a weird way, because we ourselves didn't want to stop playing the game, right?

And I think that's why these things felt more friendly, maybe a little more engaging, than a mechanic that is designed as a gacha or as a time sink.

**Dan:** I've played the game all the way through, all the levels, for testing purposes and just for fun, many times. And when I hit the end, I like the game so much — just as a player of games — that I want... The game is telling me I'm done, and I don't want to be done.

So a lot of decisions we made for post-content — like the weekly challenges is another example — is just: for people that have done the whole thing, there's still game there to play.

---

## Weekly Challenges and Silly Hats

**Dan:** So for instance, the weekly challenges was a feature we added — I don't know, a year, two years in — where on Thursday evening, if you've got push notifications enabled, you get a little ping and it says, "The challenge is live."

And it is a challenge that is live for everyone just that week. The reward for doing it — some of them are bite-sized challenges that you could do in an hour, some will take you the whole week to just chip away at — the reward is a **silly hat**.

There really is no like — it's just cosmetic.

And I think some people played it for the hat. I think myself included — I play because I didn't want to stop playing the game, and this gave me an excuse every Thursday to check back into the world of Grindstone.

It's not very heavy-handed, but it's a reason to return to this world. And I think we wanted it as developers and players that really had a fondness for the game.

And I think it coincided with the need there for people — especially, I mean, we haven't talked about this — all of this stuff, this whole live-service experience, all happened during COVID. During a lockdown. When the studio went fully remote.

We released very shortly after — the world happens, COVID happens — we're wondering what do we do. Turns out a lot of people when they're at home want to play video games. We're not the only game that experienced this.

And so a lot of our design decisions were sort of like: we want to keep playing the game, what would we want to do in this game?

---

## Onboarding and First-Time User Experience

**Kristen:** Switching topics a little bit, because it feels like you guys have — or did have — opportunities to crack the nut to get the people who are engaged more engaged, or have more ability to play the game.

Any insights on the first session that people are playing, and how to get them to want to do a second session with you? Either to teach them about the gameplay or to motivate them to come back again?

**Joel:** So onboarding and tutorialization is like a real contested bit of ground when it comes to game dev, as with everything.

Classically, there's been an ongoing debate: Do you teach players? Do you tutorialize players with lots of text? Do you do it diegetically? Do you do it artificially?

Take examples like the original Mario that you would have played in arcades — there's no text. You can only run one direction, you can only jump, you only do this one thing. So there's a whole bunch there about how do you tutorialize a game in the first place.

And then when you're dealing with mobile — where you have maybe shorter sessions, more prone to distraction — or dealing with subscription or free-to-play, where the barrier to try the game and to judge and dismiss the game is a lot lower than a game where I just dropped $70...

You have an incentive to, like — sorry, I don't know how you feel about swearing on the show — eat shit for an hour, right? Playing a bad tutorial to get to the game.

So it's funny — this is one of those places where I think I characterized it to you in a previous conversation, Kristen: PC-console developers tend to be a little bit more "artsy-fartsy," and mobile game developers tend to skew a little bit more "data pragmatism." And they love acronyms.

And Dan, I think, doesn't want to say this acronym out loud on camera, so I will: we had to become familiar with terms like **FTUE** — first-time user experience. And then again, thinking about things like retention — how many players are dropping the game within how many days.

We weren't particularly aggressive about these things. We sort of reluctantly embraced push notifications, which I think we found a tasteful way of using that worked okay for us.

But yeah, I think a large part just came down to trying to do the best job of game design. Make the hook to drive you to finish a level really strong in and of itself — which I think is one place where Grindstone excels. The hook to play a level and move on is really strong and just inherently satisfying.

And then just trying to show the player a new, interesting barrier to overcome just on the horizon. So you're never thinking about something you're going to do in 10 hours or in one week — you're thinking about the thing you might do if you could just play one more round.

**Kristen:** Love that.

Would you make a game — imagine you had kind of a little spectrum and you say, "We're here right now. We could either make it a little bit harder or a little bit easier for new folks." Where do you go? And obviously you don't want a lot harder or a lot easier, but where would you tend to have the new experience go?

---

## The Counterintuitive Power of Good Friction

**Dan:** Yeah, I mean this is always the struggle, and we fight against this in every game we make. And I don't think that we've ever totally nailed it.

But Grindstone is actually a really good example. When we started working on it in earnest, it was very easy. A level was wide open. Every chain that you plotted was a big, juicy 20-chain. And back then, it was spitting coins every kill — if you killed one guy, coins flew. Like, "You did a good job!"

And we couldn't figure out, you know, why weren't new players — new players within the studio who played the game — why weren't they pushing to make those big, juicy chains, those big, satisfying chains? Why were they just going, "Well, let's kill these three. I get coins."

**First step:** rip out the coins. Don't give them coins for every — don't pat them on the head for every little thing they do, no matter how significant or insignificant.

**Second thing** — and this is sort of counterintuitive for, I think, a FTUE, a first-time user experience — was to not make it so wide open. To introduce what I call a **"good friction."** Just a little bit of tension there, to push against — so that when you finally do achieve that big chain, *you* figured out how to do it. And it felt good. And you want to do it again.

The early game we were working on, where it was wide open — it actually didn't tell you how to play the game, in a weird way. It was too easy. So you didn't know what was the right decision.

So adding a little bit of friction, forcing the player to earn that bigger chain themselves — I think was an incentive to both "I want to keep going, I want to have that feeling again," but it also taught through play.

I don't think we nailed every aspect of our first-time user experience. But I think we tried to stay light on telling you what to do through text boxes.

**I have two kids. They skip 100% of text boxes in games. It's incredibly heartbreaking to me, since I write those most of the time. There's jokes in them. They've never — they don't see the jokes. They just skip.**

So we know that throwing up a text box that tells you how to do something is a band-aid solution in the end, really.

The best way to do it is through play and through visual cues that are easily signified. And so we tried to strike a balance between the two.

Like, here's how to do this — again, we present it diegetically with a little funny dude telling you how to do something with a joke on the end. But for the most part, the mechanic is so simple. We set up the levels to sort of guide the player through visually. And through that central chaining interaction, we did our best to make that feel juicy and satisfying to carry them through.

And then at level 20, we really turn it up a notch. We turn on the heat on the boiler, and it starts to get a lot more challenging — perhaps too challenging by level 20. But I digress.

## Hearts: Why Three is Better Than Twenty

**Kristen:** Let's also discuss these hearts. What is the heart? What are the hearts? What's the heart meter? Talk to me about how this operationally works.

Joel, do you want to take this one?

**Joel:** Well, I mean, describing it as it is in the game is pretty straightforward.

The player has three hearts. Every turn, you're making a decision about where you'll end up, and you can get caught in a situation where you could take multiple hits. But typically you'll take one hit — one hit, one heart flies off.

And it's pretty classic video games. Straightforward and simple. I think most players of Grindstone would, you know, you see it, you get it intuitively really quickly, and you wouldn't think that there's any other way the game could be.

But it actually was a different way for a long time. But that predates my tenure at Capy, so I'll flip it back to you, Dan, to talk about what it was.

**Dan:** Yeah, I mean it was more of a meter with a bunch of hit points. Like 20 hit points, 50 hit points.

And again, when you play the game, that's a very generous amount of life you're giving to the player. And what it produced was very little tension. You could basically play a lot of levels in a row without thinking about that resource — which is a resource.

And it's again another example of a sort of counterintuitive decision: to add friction, to add tension, to add difficulty — that I think enriches the game.

I don't think it is as off-putting as it sounds. It gives the game a good tension. When you achieve something, when you leave a dangerous situation with that one precious heart intact — you feel like a good player. As opposed to playing for 15 levels in a row and then realizing, "Oh, I'm a little low on hearts. I should go do something about that."

And the reason why I think it's so anomalous is just because of the genre that we're sort of playing in — which is typically very casual, at least for the early game. It tries to sand off the edges and really push the dopamine hit of just doing well and giving you shiny things.

But because we're sort of blurring the lines between a color-matching game and an action game — a sort of turn-based action game — it makes sense to have more danger. It makes sense to have more tension.

And the result is, I think we got casual color-matching players who were suddenly tricked into playing a more intense action game. And we got action-game players that were sort of tricked into playing a more casual puzzle game.

I know this anecdotally from my friend group, who very politely played my game just to be nice friends — and were texting me at 2 in the morning cursing me for level 121 that killed them.

It really engaged a kind of player that didn't play that genre typically. And I think it did that really successfully.

## Board State and Comprehensibility

**Joel:** Yeah, I think it also — just to add to it, Dan — it increases the comprehensibility of board state.

In game design, "board state" is what it sounds like: it's your ability to hold the reality of the simulation in your head.

So like, would chess be a better game if the queen could take three hits? And if you had to have some way of tracking how many hits? And if a pawn has one, and a bishop has five, and a rook has three?

Those don't make chess a better game, because the board state becomes more complex and it becomes less comprehensible.

And so I think — there are games, like some of the big RPGs that I worked on, that were squishy things with 100 hit points, and "this thing takes poison damage which adds seven" — that makes sense if you're playing Dungeons & Dragons or a big PC RPG.

But for a game like Grindstone, where board state and holding that in your head is a big part of it — it puts the player in that right... It's a dollar-store version of self-determination theory, right?

Where the player can understand what's going on well enough to feel like success or failure is **their** fault — and not the fault of the mechanism of the game clanking around.
