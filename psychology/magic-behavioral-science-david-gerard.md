# What Magicians Know About Human Behavior That Product Designers Don't

*A conversation with David Gerard — magician, mentalist, and tech veteran*

## Introduction

David Gerard is a magician and mentalist who has performed for Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley's elite, and clocked over 60 shows at Hollywood's prestigious Magic Castle. But there's more to his story — he's also spent 12 years in tech, including 5 years at Google working on products from YouTube to AdWords to Google Play.

What does magic have to do with behavioral science or product design? A lot, actually. Magicians are masters of understanding gaps in human cognition and using them to create magical experiences.

## The Currency of Attention

> "When four people from the audience start walking onto stage to music, I can get away with anything. Why? We become distracted."

David controls and moves the audience's attention at every moment. This is a fundamental lesson for product designers: **attention is the currency of behavior change and product design.** Where is the user's attention, and how can you leverage that to help them achieve their goals?

## We're Not Unique Snowflakes

When given the option of choosing a playing card or picking a country, people tend to gravitate towards the same ones. While we all want to believe we are unique snowflakes, David risks his entire show on the idea that we are not.

> "Most people want choice. So I give them the illusion of choice. Both the desire for choice and the illusion of choice are insights that apply to most people. We all act very similarly when put in similar situations."

There's even a Scientific American article from 2012 that breaks down the most popular playing cards people choose. You're never going to get a black nine — but you will hit the queen of hearts, the king of hearts, or the ace of spades.

## How Magic Actually Works

**It's all about assumptions.**

> "A key reason we get fooled is the assumptions we make about reality. The magician understands those assumptions to a very deep level and can use them to delight you or fool you."

**Example:** If David takes a red box of playing cards and removes a deck where the top card is red, everyone assumes the entire deck is red — even though every other card could be blue.

We make these assumptions because the world is complex. If we were skeptical of everything, we couldn't function. We've tuned out information overload so we can move through life faster.

**The parallel to startups:** Many teams make assumptions that turn out to be wrong. When a startup shuts down, you often hear things like "We thought people would pay $1,000 for email" or "We thought they'd never get in a car with a stranger."

Airbnb broke the assumption that people wouldn't want to sleep on a stranger's couch. Tesla broke assumptions about batteries. The most innovative companies find assumptions to hack.

## Objection Handling

> "If you're not addressing elephants in the room off the bat, users wonder: does the company know? Do they get me? Or is there something they're not saying?"

When David performs for tech crowds, he proactively states their objections before they can voice them:
- "You probably want to check these out"
- "You probably think he's in on it"
- "Everyone's chosen at random, so we have no issues"

This is identical to sales — consistently addressing what people will critique. And counterintuitively, addressing concerns upfront actually **builds trust** rather than undermining it.

---

## Surprise vs. Set Expectations

Magic tricks fall into two buckets:

1. **Set expectations:** "You're going to name a card, name a number, and it will appear exactly there." The frame is clear.
2. **Surprise:** David doesn't tell you what to expect, allowing him to work in the gray because your skepticism isn't heightened.

**Example:** A card that ends up folded underneath someone's watch. If he announced it beforehand, skepticism would be high and it wouldn't work. As a surprise, he can get away with much more.

> "Survey respondents rated 'surprise, the unexpected, and uniqueness' as the #1 thing they like most about magic — at 20%. That's above 'being amazed' (10%) and 'trying to figure out the tricks' (10%)."

**Why surprise matters now:** In our day-to-day lives, we don't have much surprise anymore. We can Google any answer. Magic is having a renaissance because surprise is a hot commodity.

## Time to Value (and Time to Amazement)

> "My two strongest things are my opener and my closer. My new opener is my old closer."

David's most fooling piece comes first. If the first thing fools the audience, they can relax. They stop trying to figure it out and just enjoy.

> "There's time to value, time to amazement, time to intrigue — we can play with these dials so people aren't tuning out. Your phone is always an option. I've got to keep you in it."

The same principle applies to landing pages with social proof, testimonials, and objection handling — letting users relax into the product experience instead of staying heightened about whether you'll steal their credit card data.

---

## Recency Bias as a Tool

> "Once all the dirty work of a magic trick is done — before the reveal — I can clean up your memory and make it seem more impossible than it actually was."

After the technique is complete, David summarizes: "Well, Kristen, you shuffled these cards, we put this in your hand, you've been here the whole time, and I haven't even moved."

If you confirm the last thing, you tend to accept everything else. People come up to him years later describing tricks using his words — but it's not actually what happened.

**The lesson:** How you frame the ending reshapes how people remember the entire experience.

---

## Visual Anchors for Memory

> "My show has a lot of physical elements left around the stage that become visual anchors later. Otherwise, you will forget."

Think about concerts: Do you remember song six? No. But you remember how they opened and closed.

---

## Framing Changes Everything

A study by Josh Jay at the College of New Jersey showed magic footage to viewers with different framing:
- **Group A** was told what they were seeing was insanely difficult
- **Group B** was told nothing

**Results:**
- 85% of those who thought it was difficult wanted to see more
- Only 33% of those told nothing wanted to continue

> "What's fascinating about magic is you don't know how hard it is because it's magic. Some of my most impressive tricks are my easiest. Some of my hardest tricks I haven't found a way to make mind-blowing. I have moves that took 20 years to learn that I don't even use."

It's like wine: if you don't know it's from the hills and costs $200, you think it's from Trader Joe's.

**David's intro before he hits the stage includes:** On tour with The Illusionist (Broadway), consulted on America's Got Talent, performed for Mark Zuckerberg, over 1,000 shows, Magic Castle residency. The audience physically shifts — this isn't a birthday party magician found online.

## The Power of Open Loops

> "Humans don't like things to be open-ended. How many times have you committed to a terrible show just to know what happens to the characters?"

At the beginning of his show, David hands out an envelope and says they'll open it at the end. His show has multiple open-ended elements that don't resolve until the finale — like a good mystery.

If he closes each piece completely, people feel like they could walk away. But with open loops? They're hooked.

**For retention:** Maybe we should promise immediate value AND big wins at 30 days, 60 days, 6 months. Hit streaks and build loops.

---

## Presence as a Hot Commodity

> "Most humans are used to getting 60-70% presence in their day-to-day life. The phone on the table, the Apple Watch buzz, people who won't look you in the eyes. We're craving presence — to be seen and heard."

If David seems distracted on stage, the audience doesn't feel like they're getting 100% of him.

**How to achieve presence:**
1. Master your craft so you're not thinking about mechanics (like a salesperson who knows their slides cold)
2. Be clear on your "why" — if your intent is self-serving, your presence will feel self-serving
3. Use just-in-time reminders (David has Post-it notes in his case: "Smile. Pause. Breathe.")

> "A famous comedian, Neal Brennan, talks about having a Pavlok that buzzes every two minutes to remind him to smile. If professional comedians need reminders, so do we."

---

## The 10x Bar

> "In the first 10 minutes with a founder, I found that the value had to be 10x to really stand out. Truly amazing. Dare I say magical."

When David tried Google Glass a decade ago, it was cool — like cotton candy. But it wasn't fulfilling.

> "Do you really deserve to be on someone's home screen? Do you deserve to be at the dinner table conversation? We get addicted to our ideas and think they're 10x, but then it falls down."

---

## Building a Magic Trick = Building a Product Experience

David's mentor Paul Vigil uses this analogy:

**The Race:** At the beginning, 100 people are running. At the end, you want zero running — they're all fooled, experiencing the impossible.

Some will stop running naturally because they want to believe. But you need to put barriers along the way:
- "I shuffled the deck"
- "The conditions were perfect"
- "I'm not in on it"

**Closing the doors:** Every objection handled, so the only thing left is impossible.

> "In a product race, you start with zero people and want 100 to finish. How will they trip and fall? How will they stay engaged? What doors do you need to close to help them get there?"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Attention is currency** — know where it is and how to direct it
2. **People are more similar than they think** — design for patterns, not snowflakes
3. **Handle objections proactively** — it builds trust, not doubt
4. **Time to value matters** — your opener should be your strongest piece
5. **Use recency bias** — how you frame the ending reshapes memory
6. **Surprise is a hot commodity** — find moments of genuine delight
7. **Keep loops open** — give people reasons to stay until the end
8. **Presence is rare** — being fully there is competitive advantage
9. **The 10x bar is real** — cotton candy doesn't cut it
10. **Close the doors** — eliminate every objection until only magic remains
